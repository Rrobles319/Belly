# Belly

## Project Overview
Roza needs to finish her Belly Button dashboard that allows volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. Thus, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
